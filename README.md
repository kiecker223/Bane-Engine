## Building
This only works on windows 10 and 11 (directx 12) building however is really straight forward
```
# Make sure directx 12 is installed
./GenerateProject.bat
# Open generated .sln file
# Use visual studio to build it
```

If it isn't already, make sure "Bane-Game" is set as the startup project. From that point you should be able to just run it
